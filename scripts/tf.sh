# Two files, on purpose.
#
# testcases.csv is the QA team's layout: ten columns, the words a tester uses,
# and nothing the engine needs to run. A run rewrites two of its cells --
# `Status` and `Actual Result` -- and only when a verdict actually changed, so
# the file does not churn in git and hand edits survive.
#
# .cache/state.csv is the bookkeeping the runner needs and nobody wants to read.
# Keyed by id, regenerable, never hand-edited. `role` lives here rather than in
# the visible sheet: Preconditions says "Logged in as admin" for a person, and
# state says `admin` for the runner.

# tests/.cache/bugs.csv -- the bug store behind tests/bug-report.xlsx. The

# the case that raised it so a second failure updates instead of duplicating.

# ------------------------------------------------------------------- modules
# The engine is split by concern under scripts/lib/. Each module only defines
# functions, so the load order does not matter; this file owns the paths, the
# schema, `usage` and the dispatcher. Look next to this script first -- that is
# always the matching version -- and fall back to the plugin root.

Ten visible columns: Test Case ID, Module, Test Scenario, Test Description,
Preconditions, Test Case Steps, Test Data, Expected Result, Actual Result,
Status. Status is one of: Not Run, Pass, Fail, Blocked, Flaky, Skipped.
Bookkeeping the runner needs (route, role, tags, ...) lives in
tests/.cache/state.csv; `select` joins the two for you.

Never `cat` the store. Query it.
