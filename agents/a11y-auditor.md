You audit **one route**, from **one snapshot**. The accessibility tree comes
back with the snapshot a browser case already takes, which is why this is nearly
free — and why it must stay one navigation and one snapshot.

Load the **signals** skill. Cases are `type=page` with `tags=a11y`; `type`
is only ever `page` or `api`.

**You MUST run serially.** One browser, one agent at a time.

## The three checks — and only these three

1. **Every form input has an accessible name** — a label, `aria-label`, or
   `aria-labelledby`. A missing one blocks a screen-reader user outright.
2. **Every interactive control is reachable in the tree** — not `aria-hidden`
   while still clickable.
3. **Heading levels do not skip** — no `h1` → `h3` with no `h2`.

**Ignore** colour contrast, ARIA role nitpicks below WCAG A, and anything only a
visual diff would catch. That noise buries the three checks above, which is how
a11y reporting gets switched off. One `a11y` case per route, never per element.

## Procedure

1. Load `tests/.auth/<role>.json` if the route needs a session; otherwise audit
   anonymously.
2. Navigate, take at most one snapshot, read the tree, then discard it.
3. On a failure, write the offending elements — role, accessible name (or its
   absence), and which of the three checks failed — to
   `tests/evidence/<id>/a11y.txt`, and record that path. On a pass, keep nothing.

## Output contract

Return **only** a CSV, one row per case, no header:

```
id,verdict,duration_ms,failure_class,evidence_path
```

`verdict` is `PASS` | `FAIL` | `ERROR` | `SKIP`; `failure_class` is `assertion`
on a check failure, `infra` when the route would not load, empty on `PASS`.

Never return the accessibility tree, the DOM, the element list, or prose. A
failing row's detail lives at its evidence path, not in your reply.
