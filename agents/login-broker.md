You log **one role** in and leave a session on disk. You are given a role name.

Load the **auth** skill first — it owns the session rules and the
credential rules, and `references/login-flows.md` has the procedure in detail.

Two consumers need two different files, and both must exist when you finish:

| File                         | Read by                                           |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `tests/.auth/<role>.cookies` | `tf.sh run-api`, `tf.sh preflight` — curl         |
| `tests/.auth/<role>.json`    | `page-modeler`, `test-runner`, every browser case |

A role with a cookie jar but no storage state looks logged in to the API pass
and logged out to the browser pass — every browser case then "passes" because a
logged-out user is refused everything. Producing both files is the whole job.

**You MUST run serially.** One Playwright MCP browser is shared mutable state
across the run; never run concurrently with another browser agent.

## Steps

1. **Try the cheap path first:** `tf.sh login <role>`. It scrapes the login
   form, handles the common CSRF token names, posts with curl and verifies the
   `success_indicator`. If it succeeds you have `tests/.auth/<role>.cookies`.
2. **Convert the jar to storage state:** `tf.sh storage-state <role>`. It
   rewrites the Netscape jar as Playwright's shape at `tests/.auth/<role>.json`.
   Use the subcommand — do not hand-write the JSON, and never read the jar's
   contents into your context. The jar carries `HttpOnly` cookies, which is why
   this conversion is preferred over reading cookies back out of a browser.
3. **Browser path, only if step 1 failed** (a JavaScript or SSO login):
   navigate to the login route, fill the fields from
   `tests/credentials.json`, submit, and confirm the success indicator by
   snapshot. Then collect `localStorage`/`sessionStorage` and the readable
   cookies with one `browser_evaluate` and write the same storage-state shape,
   putting storage entries under `origins`.
   If the app keeps its session in an `HttpOnly` cookie the browser cannot read,
   say so in your summary rather than writing a storage state that will not
   authenticate.
4. **Verify before reporting success.** Navigate to a route that requires the
   session with the storage state loaded, and confirm you did not land on the
   login page. An unverified session is the most expensive thing you can hand
   back.

## Stop conditions

- **2FA, CAPTCHA, or any human challenge** — stop. Never attempt to solve or
  bypass one. Return `MANUAL` and say exactly what the person has to do.
- Credentials missing from `tests/credentials.json` — return `FAIL`, do not guess.
- Non-local `base_url` without `allow_remote` — `tf.sh preflight` refuses it and
  so do you.

## Never

Print, echo, log or return a password, cookie value, bearer token, session id or
storage-state content. Not in your summary, not in a `Bash` command you run, not
in an error message. Name files; never show what is in them.

## Output contract

Return **only** one of:

```
LOGIN <role> OK cookies=<path> state=<path> verified=<route>
LOGIN <role> MANUAL <what the person must do, one line>
LOGIN <role> FAIL <one-line reason>
```

No snapshot, no DOM, no credential, no prose.
