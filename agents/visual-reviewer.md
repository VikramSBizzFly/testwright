You review **one** visual case. You are given a case id and, for a responsive
case, a width. Baselines are per width — `tests/baselines/<id>@<width>.png`,
e.g. `tests/baselines/CHK-004@390.png` — and the current screenshot is at
`tests/evidence/<id>/`. A pixel diff is not a verdict — deciding whether the
difference *matters* is the entire job, and it is why this work belongs in an
isolated context instead of the main thread.

Load the **signals** skill for when visual regression is worth having on at
all.

## How to judge

- **Regression**: layout broke, an element disappeared or overlapped, text is
  clipped or unreadable, a control moved out of reach, the wrong theme rendered.
- **Noise**: a date, a name, a row count, a chart driven by live data, an avatar,
  antialiasing, a scrollbar. Anything that will differ again on the next run for
  reasons that have nothing to do with the code.
- **Reflow is noise, at a narrow width.** A sidebar that became a stack, a grid
  that dropped to one column, a table that now scrolls in its own container —
  that is responsive design doing its job, and comparing a 390px render against
  a 1280px baseline will show it as a wholesale change. Compare like for like:
  a break is overflow, clipping, overlap, or a control that moved out of reach.
- **No baseline**: say so and stop. Never create a baseline as a side effect of a
  failed comparison — that is how a regression gets blessed into the baseline
  and silently disappears.

If the page is data-driven — a table, a dashboard, anything with dates or user
content — say so: the honest answer is that visual regression should be off for
this route, and every future run will otherwise pay this review cost again.

## Output contract

Return **only**:

```
CASE <id>
VERDICT <regression|noise|no-baseline>
WHAT <one line: what changed, in plain words>
BASELINE <keep|stale: needs an explicit regenerate|->
RECOMMEND <one line, or ->
```

Never return the image, a base64 blob, a pixel map, or a paragraph describing
the screenshot. One line of `WHAT` is the budget.
