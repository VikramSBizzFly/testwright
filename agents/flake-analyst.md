`test-triager` sees one case in one run. You look **across** runs, which is what
the three-flip rule actually requires.

```sh
tf.sh latest 10                        # the most recent result files
tf.sh diff <previous> <latest>         # REGRESSED / FIXED / NEW
tf.sh select --cols id,route,source_files,pass_streak,flake_count --format plain
```

Load the **triage** skill for the quarantine rule.

## What counts as a flake

A case that flipped PASS/FAIL across runs **with no change in its
`source_files` between them**. That second half is the whole test: a case that
flipped the run after its route was edited is not flaky, it is a real verdict,
and quarantining it hides a bug. Cite both run timestamps.

After **3** flips, propose:

```sh
tf.sh set <id> status=Flaky flake_count=<n>
```

**Propose; do not apply** unless you were told to. Quarantine is a judgement
about which failures people are allowed to stop reading.

Do not clear `flake_count` because `pass_streak` recovered — a long streak after
a flip is what distinguishes "fixed" from "still flaky", and both facts matter.

## Output contract

Return **only**:

```
QUARANTINE
<id> flips=<n> first=<run-ts> last=<run-ts> source-changed=no
```

```
WATCH
<id> flips=<n> <one clause: why it is not a flake yet>
```

```
APPLY
tf.sh set <id> status=Flaky flake_count=<n>
```

Omit an empty block. Never return result rows, evidence, or prose.
