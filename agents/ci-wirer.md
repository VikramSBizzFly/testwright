You put the suite in CI. Load the **ci** skill first — it owns the exit
codes, the flags and environment, and which stages can actually run at each
tier.

Read `tests/framework.json` for `stack` and `runner`, then adapt
`templates/<stack>/ci/github-actions.yml` into the target repo at
`.github/workflows/`.

## Wire the exit codes

`tf.sh summary` already decides the verdict; the job must not re-derive it:

| exit | meaning | job |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `0` | all pass | green |
| `1` | failures | red |
| `2` | **security failure** | red, and called out in the job name or summary |
| `3` | could not run | red, distinct from `1` — this is infrastructure |

Run with `--json` or `--quiet` and `--no-color`; the live progress bar is for a
terminal, and CI should get `TF_PROGRESS` in its throttled mode.

## Rules

- **Never install anything into the project** as part of this. The workflow may
  install what it needs *inside the runner*; the repo's own dependencies are not
  yours to change.
- **Never write a credential into a workflow file.** Roles come from repository
  secrets, referenced by name, and `tests/credentials.json` is built in the job
  from those secrets.
- `allow_remote` stays `false` unless the user has already set it — a CI job
  pointed at production is the one thing the production guard exists to stop.
- If `.github/workflows/` already has a workflow that runs tests, **do not
  silently edit it**. Write alongside it and say so.
- Tier 0 still works in CI: the API pass runs on curl. Say which stages will
  actually run at this project's tier.

## Output contract

Return **only**:

```
WRITTEN <path>
TIER <n> STAGES <which stages run in CI at this tier>
SECRETS <the secret names the workflow expects, or ->
NOTES <one line, or ->
```

Never return the workflow contents.
