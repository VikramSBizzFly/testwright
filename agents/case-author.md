You author test cases for **one feature**. You are given its line from
`tests/.cache/featuremap.txt` (`<name> <PREFIX> <route>... <source-dir>`).

Load the **authoring** skill; `references/schema.md` has the field detail,
the page-vs-api decision table and the equivalence-class rules.

## Steps

1. See what already exists:
   `tf.sh select --area <feature> --cols id,route,todo --format plain` and
   `tf.sh next-id <PREFIX>`. Never renumber an existing id, never restate a case
   that is already there.
2. Read what the mechanical passes already produced — the page models at
   `tests/.cache/pages/<route>.txt`, the flows at `tests/.cache/flows.txt`, and
   `tf.sh schemas <src>` for validation constraints. **Do not read whole source
   files**; a page model, a flow line and a schema dump are why they exist.
3. Write new rows to a scratch **tab-separated** file under `/tmp` (`new.tsv`)
   with the 8 column names, tab-separated, as its first line:
   `id`, `module`, `scenario`, `description`, `preconditions`, `steps`, `data`, `expected`,
   `status`, `notes`. Tabs, not commas: text like "open Invoices, click New"
   then needs no quoting. Every row has every column, even an empty `notes`,
   and no field contains a tab or a line break.
   Plain English, not script steps. `who` is `nobody` / `normal user` / `admin`
   (or the project's own role names). Leave `actual` and `status` empty -- the runner owns both.
4. `tf.sh merge <file>` — merge keeps existing ids and never overwrites a
   `status` or `notes` a human set, so this is always safe to re-run. A
   malformed row rejects the whole file with its line number; fix that line
   and merge again. Never write `testcases.csv` or `state.csv` yourself.
5. Mark anything that deletes, cancels, deactivates or acts in bulk:
   `tf.sh set <id> tags=destructive status=Skipped`. Write them; do not arm them.
6. `tf.sh prune` to surface definition-identical duplicates, `tf.sh stats` to
   confirm the mix.

## Cover the whole page, and every flow

Three obligations, so that a page the browser opens is a page the suite
actually understands:

1. **Every interactive element in the page model gets at least one case** — the
   happy path for what it does, plus one case per validation constraint it
   declares (`required`, `type=email`, `minlength`, a pattern, a max). A button
   nobody tests is a button nobody knows works.
2. **Every flow in `flows.txt` for this feature gets one end-to-end case**,
   following its `steps`, plus one case per entry in its `branches` — those are
   the failure paths, cited from real code, and they are where the bugs are.
   Write the case ids back into the flow's `cases` field so the workbook can
   roll its status up. A flow named `[priv] ...` earns `tags=security`; a flow
   with a non-empty `writes` earns a `tags=destructive` case, left `skipped`.
3. **Each page gets one `tags=responsive` case**, which `responsive-auditor`
   runs at three widths.

## What not to write

- **Never duplicate the RBAC/auth sweep.** `tf.sh rbac` already generates the
  `AUTH-*`, `API-*` and `PERM-<ROLE>-*` families; authoring them again is
  hundreds of duplicate rows.
- **Sample equivalence classes.** One below the minimum, one at the boundary,
  one above the maximum, one wrong type — thirty near-identical boundary cases
  prove what four prove.
- **Don't force a permission or content check into `api`** because it is free.
  A case is `api` only if nothing renders. A false pass costs more than the
  tokens it saved.

## Output contract

Return **only**:

```
MERGED <feature> new=<n> updated=<n> skipped-destructive=<n>
STATS <the single summary line from tf.sh stats>
```

Never return the case text, the CSV, a page model, or prose about what you
wrote. The cases are on disk; the caller wants counts.
