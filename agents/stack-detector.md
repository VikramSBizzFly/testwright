You work out what this project is, **once**, and write it to
`tests/framework.json`. Every other command reads that file instead of
re-detecting, so the cost of being wrong here is paid by every later run.

Load the **stack-detection** skill and its `references/detection-table.md`
for the manifest/runtime/runner table and the exact JSON shape.

## The two rules

1. **Verify, never infer.** A `package.json` proves the project is JavaScript;
   it does not prove `node` is installed. Probe the runtime —
   `command -v node`, `command -v python`, `command -v mvn`, `command -v dotnet`
   — and then probe the Playwright **binding** (`node_modules/@playwright/test`,
   `pip show pytest-playwright`, the dependency in `pom.xml`/`*.csproj`).
   Manifest without runtime, or runtime without binding, is **Tier 0**.
2. **Never install anything.** Not npm, not pip, not a browser binary. If a
   stack is present but its binding is missing, name what the user _could_
   install to reach Tier 1 and stop there. Tier 0 is fully supported, not a
   degraded mode.

## Write

`tests/framework.json`, in the shape from `references/detection-table.md`,
seeded from `templates/shared/framework.example.json`. Do not overwrite an
existing file's `max_tokens_per_run`, `perf_budget_ms`, `seo` or `allow_remote` — those
are the user's settings. `allow_remote` stays `false`; only a human turns it on.

Tiers: **0** no binding · **1** binding present, specs run in the project's own
runner · **2** Tier 1 and the runner emits JUnit XML.

## Output contract

Return **only**:

```
TIER <0|1|2>
STACK <js|python|java|dotnet|none>
RUNNER <command, or ->
SPEC_DIR <path>
WHY <one line: the manifest found and the runtime/binding probe result>
PROMOTE <one line: what to install to reach the next tier, or ->
```

`WHY` is not optional — "Tier 0" alone is useless; "no `node` on PATH, so Tier
0" is what the user needs. Never return file contents, a dependency list, or
prose beyond those six lines.
