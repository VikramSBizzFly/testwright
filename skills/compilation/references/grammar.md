# Recipe grammar

One verb per line, plain text, no quoting rules beyond `"..."` around
multi-word literal text. Comments are not needed — a recipe is generated, not
hand-edited.

```
nav <path>                         direct navigation, storage state already loaded
fill <type>:<name> <value>         <value> is a literal, or $role.username / $role.password
click <type>:<name>
select <type>:<name> <value>
check <type>:<name>
uncheck <type>:<name>
expect url <path>
expect text <type>:<name> "<text>"
expect not-text <type>:<name> "<text>"
expect visible <type>:<name>
expect absent <type>:<name>
expect any-of [ <condition>, <condition>, ... ]
```

`expect not-text` passes when the named element's text does **not** contain
the literal — use it for "the page must not show the data that belongs to
someone else" style refusals, where there is no fixed string to match.

`expect any-of [ ... ]` passes if any one nested condition passes. Its
condition list uses the same verbs minus the `expect` prefix, e.g.
`expect any-of [ url /login, text alert:error "Forbidden", text alert:error "Access denied" ]`.
This exists because apps disagree on how they refuse: some redirect to
login, some render a banner, some show a 403 page with its own wording —
compiling one hard-coded string would make the case brittle to phrasing the
case never claimed to test.

`<type>:<name>` is the accessible role and name exactly as the page model
listed it — `textbox:Email`, `button:Sign in`, `link:Forgot password?`. The
compiler copies these straight out of the page model; it never invents a
selector. If a case needs an element the page model does not have, that route
needs re-modeling, not a guessed selector.

`expect` lines only ever appear last, and there is normally exactly one.
Two are acceptable when the case genuinely asserts two independent outcomes
(e.g. `expect url` and `expect text` after a redirect that also shows a
banner) — never as a substitute for splitting the case.

## Worked example

Case `AUTH-014`: _"a valid login lands on the dashboard"_, who `normal
user`, route `/login`.

```
nav /login
fill textbox:Email $role.username
fill textbox:Password $role.password
click button:Sign in
expect url /dashboard
```

Case `INV-009`: _"an invoice amount under the minimum is rejected"_,
who `normal user`, route `/invoices/new`.

```
nav /invoices/new
fill textbox:Amount 0
click button:Save
expect text alert:error "must be greater than 0"
```

Neither recipe contains a role name, an intermediate assertion, or a click
that exists only to navigate. That is the whole target.

## Worked example — a rendered permission refusal

Case `PERM-ADM-003`: _"log in as normal user and open the admin settings
page — should not open, I am not allowed to see this"_, who `normal user`,
route `/admin/settings`. A curl status check would miss this if the app
serves the settings page at 200 with an "Access denied" body, or guards it
client-side after the shell has already loaded:

```
nav /admin/settings
expect any-of [ url /login, text alert:error "Forbidden", text alert:error "Access denied" ]
```

If the page instead renders normally but must not show another tenant's
data:

```
nav /invoices/1042
expect not-text cell:owner "Acme Corp"
```

## Compiling from the page model

The page model gives you the element inventory and validation constraints;
the case's **Preconditions**, **Test Case Steps**, **Test Data** and **Expected Result** give you the scenario.
Translate mechanically:

- a **Test Case Steps** cell like `Fill Email | Fill Password | Click Sign in`
  becomes one `fill`/`click` line per segment, in order
- a field's boundary constraint (`minlen=8`, `required`, `type=email`) is
  what justifies a boundary case's `fill` value — pull the value from the
  case row, not from the page model; the model only tells you _which_
  constraint is being tested
- **Expected Result** becomes the trailing `expect` line(s); pick
  `expect url` for navigation, `expect text`/`expect not-text` for a
  message or its absence, `expect visible`/`expect absent` for an element
  appearing or disappearing, `expect any-of` when the case only says "should
  not open" without naming the app's specific refusal mechanism

If the steps or the expected result can't be mapped onto the model's
element inventory at all, do not guess — leave the case `status=Not Run` and
note why.
