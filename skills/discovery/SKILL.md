# Discovery

> `tf.sh` = `"$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/tf.sh"` (not on PATH).

Most of this is mechanical. **Do not read source files to answer a question
a glob can answer.**

## Step 1 — deterministic extraction (free)

```sh
tf.sh routes  <src> > tests/.cache/routes.txt   # route list, all frameworks
tf.sh forms   <src>                             # files containing forms
tf.sh schemas <src>                             # validation constraints
tf.sh hash    <src> > tests/.cache/hash         # cache key
```

`tf.sh routes` covers Next.js, React/Vue Router, Django, Flask/FastAPI, Rails,
Spring, ASP.NET and Express, and doesn't classify what it finds — skim and
delete non-routes rather than re-deriving the list yourself.

`tf.sh schemas` finds the constraints the code declares — Zod, Pydantic,
Jakarta, DataAnnotations. That is what the app *says*, which is not the same as
what a field of that sort needs tested. When a form is found, name each field's
**kind** (person name, money, OTP, file upload) alongside its declared
constraints, so authoring can look up the rest in the **authoring** skill's
`references/field-library.md`. A field the code constrains not at all still has
a kind, and that is usually the interesting case.

## Step 2 — cache check

`tf.sh cache-check <src>` — **exit 0 means stop.** Source unchanged, so
`tests/.cache/` is current and regeneration is free. Exit 1 means cold or
stale: rebuild only the affected areas. It does the hash comparison itself;
do not eyeball it.

## Step 3 — the judgements only you can make (one pass over the route list, not per-route work)

**a. Classify each route `page` or `api`.** `/api/`-style, JSON/status only
→ `api`. Everything a person navigates to and looks at, including a page
that only ever refuses access → `page`. `tf.sh rbac` already applies this.

**b. Group routes into features and name them.** `/invoices`, `/invoices/1`,
`/invoices/new` are one feature, `invoice`. Assign a stable ID prefix and
write `feature PREFIX routes... src_dir` to `tests/.cache/featuremap.txt`
(format: `references/live-crawl-and-delegation.md`).

**c. Identify privileged routes.** Read the auth guards (`middleware.ts`,
`@PreAuthorize`, `[Authorize]`, `before_action`) and list routes requiring
elevated roles, one per line, to `tests/.cache/privileged.txt`. Then
`tf.sh rbac tests/.cache/routes.txt tests/.cache/privileged.txt > /tmp/rbac.csv
&& tf.sh merge /tmp/rbac.csv`. Without that list `tf.sh rbac` falls back to a
name heuristic and says so — this cheap pass makes hundreds of free
permission cases _correct_, not guessed.

## Step 4, delegation, and never

Live-crawl only when static discovery clearly missed routes, and delegate it to
the `route-crawler` agent (serial — it shares the one browser); run
`test-explorer` agents in parallel only over the static pass. Procedure and
the crawl/run serialization rule: `references/live-crawl-and-delegation.md`.

Once features are named, hand each one to the `flow-mapper` agent — it reads
that area's code and writes the flows behind those routes to
`tests/.cache/flows.txt`. Routes tell you where the app goes; flows tell you
what it is for. See the **flows** skill.

Never: read whole source files into the main thread, enumerate routes by hand,
re-explore an unchanged repo, or return snapshots/DOM to the caller.
