# testwright

testwright writes the tests for you. Point it at any web app and it finds the
pages, turns them into a plain-English test suite, and runs it — driving a real
browser through Playwright for anything a user would click through, and `curl`
for `/api/*` endpoints.

Works with any stack. Nothing is installed into your project.

## Install

```
/plugin marketplace add VikramSBizzFly/testwright
/plugin install testwright@bizzfly
```

`bizzfly` is the marketplace; `testwright` is the plugin inside it.

Restart Claude Code. To update later: `/plugin marketplace update bizzfly`

Browser tests need the **Playwright MCP**. A bundled `.mcp.json` declares it —
delete that file if you already have the Playwright MCP plugin, so you don't run
two copies.

New here? **[TRY-IT.md](TRY-IT.md)** walks through it in plain language.

## Upgrading from test-framework 1.x

The plugin was called `test-framework` and lived in a marketplace of the same
name. Drop the old one first, then install the new:

```
/plugin marketplace remove test-framework
/plugin marketplace add VikramSBizzFly/testwright
/plugin install testwright@bizzfly
```

Your project is untouched by the rename — the `tests/` workbooks, suites,
credentials and cached CSVs all carry over as they are, and nothing needs
migrating.

What changed is what you type. The `/test-setup`, `/test-run` and `/test-report`
commands are gone; use `/testwright:setup`, `/testwright:run` and
`/testwright:report`. Skills dropped their `test-` prefix too — `test-discovery`
is now `testwright:discovery`, and so on.

## Commands

Type them qualified, as below. Claude Code also accepts the bare `/setup`,
`/run` and `/report`, but those can sit beside another plugin's commands of the
same name, and `/testwright:` never does.

```
/testwright:setup              detect the stack, create tests/, log in per role
/testwright:setup --ci         the same, plus a CI workflow for your project
/testwright:run                find pages, write tests, run them, show the result
/testwright:report             show the last result again
/testwright:report --coverage  what has no tests
/testwright:report --flakes    cases that flip verdict without a code change
/testwright:report --bug <id>  record a failure in tests/bug-report.xlsx
/testwright:report --publish   the last result as a shareable page
```

**What `/testwright:run` runs** — one of these, `--changed` if you say nothing:

```
--changed           only what your last commit touched
--all               the whole suite
--feature <name>    one area, e.g. --feature invoices
--only-failing      just what failed last time
```

**What it adds to the run** — each one is optional:

```
--crawl             open the app to find pages the source didn't reveal
--responsive        check each page at phone, tablet and desktop widths
--a11y              check each page works for a screen-reader user
--security          probe permission boundaries a role sweep can't reach
--allow-destructive also run the tests that delete or cancel things
--fresh             rewrite the tests even if nothing changed
--headed            show the browser instead of running it hidden
```

A full browser run takes minutes, so the whole suite is always an explicit
`--all`. Use `--headed` to watch the browser when a test fails and the log
doesn't say why.

`/testwright:setup --tier 0` forces the browser-only tier if you don't want
specs written into your project.

## It starts on its own

You don't have to remember the commands. Ask for what you want in plain
language — *"find bugs in my app"*, *"can a normal user see the payroll page?"*,
*"test my API"*, *"what isn't tested?"* — and the plugin picks it up, works out
whether the project is set up yet, and routes to the right command.

**What it does without asking:** check the app is up, detect the stack, discover
routes, and run the `curl` cases. All of that is free.

**What it always asks about first:** a full browser run (it tells you how many
cases and roughly how long), anything destructive, and any non-local target.

It stays out of the way when the request isn't web-app QA — a unit test for one
function, or a question about the test library your project already uses, is not
this plugin's job and it will say so rather than take over.

Two things make this work: a `qa` skill that Claude selects from your wording,
and a `UserPromptSubmit` hook (`hooks/hooks.json`) that adds one line of context
when your prompt mentions testing. The hook is active as soon as the plugin is
installed, prints nothing on prompts that don't match, and never blocks a
prompt. To switch it off, disable the plugin's hooks in `/config`, or delete
`hooks/hooks.json` from the installed copy.

## The workbooks

Everything lives in two Excel files under `tests/`. They are the only files you
open.

**`tests/testcases.xlsx`** — three sheets:

| Sheet | What's in it |
| --- | --- |
| **Flows** | what the software actually does, end to end: the journey, the code path behind it, what it writes, how it can fail, and which cases cover it |
| **Test Cases** | every case, in the columns a QA team works in |
| **Results** | the last run, case by case |

The **Test Cases** sheet has exactly these ten columns:

| Test Case ID | Module | Test Scenario | Test Description | Preconditions | Test Case Steps | Test Data | Expected Result | Actual Result | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AUTH-002 | payroll | Logged-out visitor opens /payroll | | Not logged in | Open /payroll | | Sends me to the login page | HTTP 200, payroll rendered | Fail |
| PERM-USER-001 | payroll | A normal user opens /payroll | | Logged in as normal user | Open /payroll | | Refused | | Not Run |

**Status** is `Not Run`, `Pass`, `Fail`, `Blocked` (the run could not judge it —
the app never answered), `Flaky` or `Skipped`. A case goes `Flaky` only after it
flips verdict three times with no matching source change; flaky cases are listed
separately and do not set the verdict. **Preconditions** is plain words, and the
engine reads the login part of it: "Not logged in" runs without a session,
"Logged in as admin" runs as admin.

**`tests/bug-report.xlsx`** — one **Bugs** sheet, in the team's bug-sheet columns:
Bug No, Module, Bug Description, Steps to Reproduce, Expected Result, Actual
Result, Test data, Status(QA), QA Comments, Severity, Priority, Reporter,
Environment, Access Link, Bug Link, found date, Dev Comment.

A bug is recorded **only when triage calls a failure a real app bug** — never
for an out-of-date test, a server that was down, or a case that flips on its
own. The plugin fills in everything it can look up (the steps, what should and
did happen, who reported it, where, the link, the date) and supplies a
description, severity and priority. A second failure updates the same bug
instead of duplicating it, and a Closed bug that fails again is Reopened.

**The plugin keeps both up to date.** After every run each case gets its
verdict and what actually happened written back, and each flow's status is
rolled up from the cases covering it — `passing` only if they all passed, and
**`not covered`** when nothing tests it at all. The run ends by naming any open
bug whose case now passes, so you know what to retest. A verdict that didn't
change rewrites nothing, so your git history stays clean.

**You can edit both.** In Test Cases, change anything, add a row and leave the
id blank — the next run reads it back in, and a hand edit always wins. In the
bug report you own Status(QA), QA Comments, Severity, Priority, Bug Link and Dev
Comment; the rest is regenerated from the case, so a stale copy can't overwrite
it. Nothing you write is deleted by a regeneration.

Underneath, the engine reads CSV copies in `tests/.cache/` — awk can't read a
ZIP of XML. You never touch them. Writing the workbooks needs Python on your
machine; without it the framework falls back to plain CSV and says so.

## What a run looks like

```
╭─ TEST RUN ── hrms ──────────────────────────────── 14:53:16 ╮
│  94 cases   █████████████████░░░  85%   4.2s                │
│  ✓ pass 80    ✗ fail 12   ! error 2   ○ skip 3              │
╰─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯

  ⚠  SECURITY - privilege boundary crossed
     RBAC-USER-002   user      → /payroll               200

  → /testwright:report --bug RBAC-USER-002
```

A clean run is three lines and a next step. Security failures are pinned at the
top and set the verdict — 91% green while a logged-out visitor can read payroll
is not a passing run.

Exit codes for CI: `0` pass · `1` failures · `2` security failure · `3` couldn't
run. `3` is deliberately separate: an app that never started is not a test
result. `--json`, `--quiet`, `--ascii` and `--no-color` are also available.

## Why a real browser

A status code can't tell a refusal from a leak. A page saying "Access denied" and
a page dumping every salary both return `200 OK`. A page can also redirect you to
`/login` with JavaScript, which `curl` never sees. So permission checks run in a
real browser and read what the page actually says.

That costs tokens. Three things keep it bounded:

- **Each page is understood once.** One agent reads it and writes a compact page
  model; every case on that route is then compiled into a replayable recipe
  without opening a browser again.
- **Each stage runs in its own agent.** Snapshots, DOM, evidence files and
  credentials never enter the main conversation, so the expensive context stays
  small. That isolation *is* the cost model.
- **If your project has Playwright installed**, passing cases are promoted into
  real spec files in your own runner — after that the suite re-runs headless for
  zero tokens. `/api/*` cases already run at zero cost, on plain `curl`.

Cost scales with the number of *pages*, not the number of tests.

## What else it can check

Three optional passes ride on browser cases you are already running:

- **`--a11y`** — from the accessibility tree each page snapshot already returns:
  every input has an accessible name, every control is reachable, heading levels
  don't skip. Not a WCAG audit; the three failures that actually block someone.
- **`--responsive`** — each page at 390, 768 and 1280: horizontal overflow,
  clipped or overlapping text, controls pushed off-screen, a nav that never
  collapses, tap targets too small to hit. Reflow is not a failure — a stacking
  sidebar is the design working.
- **`--security`** — the boundaries a role-by-route sweep can't express: opening
  another account's record by id, reaching an unlinked route, reusing a session
  after logout, and open redirects. **Authorization probing only** — never
  injection, brute force or anything destructive.
- **Visual regression** — opt-in, per page. Worth it where markup is stable and a
  pixel change is the whole risk; a waste on anything driven by live data.

## Tiers

Detected automatically at `/testwright:setup`. **Nothing is ever installed for
you.**

| Tier | When | Browser re-runs | Added to your project |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **0** | no test runtime | replayed via the MCP | **nothing** |
| **1** | your stack's Playwright binding is installed | your own runner | specs + config, in your language |
| **2** | Tier 1 + JUnit XML | your own runner | Tier 1 + a results adapter |

Tier 0 is the default and fully supported, not a degraded mode. A Python or Go
project never gets Node forced on it. In CI, Tier 0 runs the `curl` pass only —
recipe replay needs the Playwright MCP, which a CI runner doesn't have.

## Safety

- **Production guard** — refuses any non-local `base_url` unless
  `tests/framework.json` sets `"allow_remote": true`.
- **Destructive tests are opt-in** — written, tagged, and left `skipped` until
  `--allow-destructive`.
- **Credentials stay in `tests/credentials.json`** (gitignored) and never reach
  transcripts, results, specs, evidence, bug reports or CI workflow files.
- **A human challenge stops the run.** 2FA and CAPTCHA are handed back to you;
  the framework never attempts to solve or bypass one.
- **`--security` probes authorization, nothing else**, and never acts on what it
  reaches — no deleting, modifying or exporting the data a probe exposes.
- **Your source is read-only.** The framework writes under `tests/` and appends to
  `.gitignore`. Nothing else.

## Under the hood

`scripts/tf.sh` is the deterministic engine — POSIX `sh` + `awk` + `curl`, run by
Claude's Bash tool, **not a dependency of your project**. It does everything the
model shouldn't have to: CSV queries, route discovery, the RBAC matrix, HTTP
execution, regression diffing, report rendering.

It is one entry point and a handful of modules under `scripts/lib/`, one per
concern: `store.sh` (the case store), `integrity.sh` (validation, backups,
`check`/`restore`), `auth.sh` (sessions), `api.sh` (`run-api`),
`discovery.sh`, `generate.sh`, `report.sh`, `bugs.sh` (the bug store),
`migrate.sh`, `xlsx.sh`, and the shared `core.sh`/`progress.sh`. Always call
`tf.sh`; the modules are not commands.

```sh
tf.sh select --status "Not Run" --tag smoke --cols id,steps --format plain
tf.sh routes src/ > tests/.cache/routes.txt
tf.sh run-api
tf.sh storage-state admin   # cookie jar -> Playwright session
tf.sh xlsx                  # rebuild the workbook
tf.sh xlsx --import         # pull hand edits out of the sheet
tf.sh xlsx --status         # write verdicts back after a run
tf.sh preflight             # app up, and every role's session really works
tf.sh check                 # does the case store parse?
tf.sh restore               # put back the last store that did
tf.sh migrate               # force a migration (normally automatic)
tf.sh version
tf.sh help
```

Progress goes to **stderr** (so stdout stays clean for `--json`): a live bar in a
real terminal, throttled plain lines in Claude Code and CI (capped at 10 per run),
nothing under `--quiet`. A crossed privilege boundary prints the moment it's
found. `tf.sh watch` renders a live bar in a second terminal.

Above the engine sit **14 skills** — the rules for each stage, loaded only when
that stage runs, addressed as `testwright:discovery`, `testwright:triage` and so
on — and **20 agents**, one per stage:

| Stage | Agent |
| --- | --- |
| detect the stack | `stack-detector` |
| map the flows through the code | `flow-mapper` |
| log in, both session formats | `login-broker` |
| group routes into features | `test-explorer` |
| find routes a glob missed | `route-crawler` |
| write the cases | `case-author`, `api-case-author` |
| model a route, once | `page-modeler` |
| compile cases to recipes, no browser | `test-compiler` |
| replay in a browser | `test-runner` |
| accessibility, responsive, visual, authorization | `a11y-auditor`, `responsive-auditor`, `visual-reviewer`, `security-prober` |
| diagnose a failure | `test-triager`, `flake-analyst` |
| promote to native specs | `spec-writer` |
| report | `bug-reporter`, `coverage-analyst` |
| CI | `ci-wirer` |

Every agent returns a fixed, terse block — verdict rows, file paths, counts —
never a snapshot or a file's contents.

## Versioning

The version lives in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`; `tf.sh version` prints it,
and [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) says what changed. Semver, where "breaking"
means *your existing suite stops running*:

- **MAJOR** — you have to do something: the `testcases.csv` schema changed, a
  `tf.sh` subcommand or flag was removed or renamed, a command or skill was
  renamed so what you type changes, or your suite needs `tf.sh migrate` before
  it runs again.
- **MINOR** — new agents, commands, skills, flags or subcommands. Existing
  suites keep working untouched.
- **PATCH** — fixes and wording. No new surface.

`2.0.0` is a MAJOR for the rename reason only: moving to testwright changed
every command and skill name. No workbook, suite or stored file changed.

## Status

Verified end to end against a purpose-built fixture app (`example/demo-app.py`):
stack detection, route discovery, RBAC and auth-boundary generation, login with
CSRF handling, the cookie-jar-to-browser-session conversion, HTTP execution, the
summary panel and its exit codes, progress reporting, and the reporting commands.

The browser loop is real, not a plan — permission checks navigate, click, and read
the live page. The JS and Python JUnit→CSV adapters were run against sample
output; the Java and .NET adapters were not (no JDK or dotnet SDK available). The
`--a11y` and `--security` passes are new: the rules and agents are in place, but
they have not yet been run end to end against the fixture.

## Playwright MCP naming

The browser agents declare both tool prefixes, since either can apply depending on
how Playwright got installed:

- `mcp__playwright__*` — the bundled `.mcp.json` provides the server
- `mcp__plugin_playwright_playwright__*` — you already have the Playwright MCP plugin

If you add the MCP under a different server name, add that prefix to every agent
that drives a browser: `page-modeler`, `test-runner`, `login-broker`,
`route-crawler`, `a11y-auditor` and `security-prober`.
